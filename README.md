# Starfury

This is a weekend project to create a game that looks like an 80s vector art arcade game for Babylon 5.  
It is incomplete at this time, there was a more complete version with a few missions but I seem to have
lost it. If I have time I'll come back to this and add more.

Instead of using 2D sprites, it uses geometries which contain a list of drawing commands to draw lines
to the screen. This is meant to roughly mimic the way the old arcade games would send vector drawing 
commands to the graphic hardware in the machine. 

It is done in TypeScript, targeting modern browsers, without using external libraries.

There is a [playable version](https://michaelfiber.itch.io/starfury) on Itch.io
